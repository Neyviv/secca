# Description
Secca is a fortune-like program that prints a random quote from my selection of Outer Wilds quotes.

Obviously don't install if you haven't played the game, but I don't think that seeing the quotes out of context will spoil anything. 

# Planned features
- Filtering on and optional display of all fields :
  - Name
  - Quote
  - Location
  - Context
